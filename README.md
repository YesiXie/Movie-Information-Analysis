# MovieInformationAnalysis

The project is based on IMDb data from IMDb.com. The data warehouse is built for users who are interested in the movie data. The goal of the data warehouse is to show some statistical analysis about movie data from 2011 to 2018. The website will show this statistical analysis by various tables and graphs.
Three different databases are used which in this project based on MySQL, MongoDB and Neo4j. These three databases save same data in different architectures and use different database language to achieve some data warehouse query.
For the front-end structure, PHP is used to call data from MySQL, MongoDB and Neo4j, and html to do page design. 

# How to set up the project:
1.There are three sql files for mysql (IMDB.sql, bar.sql, line.sql)ï¼Œimport them into mysql database, please import IMDB.sql first.

2.There are one cypher file for neo4j (allCQL.cypher), import it into neo4j database. Then unwind data and build relationship of these tables:


  match (b:basic) unwind (b.genres) as bb create(s:newbasic{tconst:b.tconst,titleType:b.titleType,primaryTitle:b.primaryTitle,originalTitle:b.originalTitle,isAdult:b.isAdult,startYear:b.startYear,endYear:b.endYear,runtimeMinutes:b.runtimeMinutes,genres:bb})

  Match (r:ratings),(b:basic) where r.tconst=b.tconst create (r)-[re: evaluate_for]->(b) return re

  Match (a:akas),(b:basic) where a.titleId=b.tconst create (a)<-[r: display_in]-(b) return r

  Match (p:principals),(b:basic) where p.tconst = b.tconst create (p)-[r: act_in]->(b) return r

  Match (r:ratings),(b:newbasic) where r.tconst=b.tconst create (r)-[re:newevaluate_for]->(b) return re

  Match (a:akas),(b:newbasic) where a.titleId=b.tconst create (a)<-[r:newdisplay_in]-(b) return r

  Match (p:principals),(b:newbasic) where p.tconst = b.tconst create (p)-[r:newact_in]->(b) return r

  Match (n:name),(p:principals) where n.nconst=p.nconst create (p)<-[r:information_in]-(n) return r
  

  run these queries in order.


  3.import mergedALL.json into mongodb database.
